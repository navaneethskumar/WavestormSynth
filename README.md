1)Oscillator : I am using an oscillator for sound generation, and it support different types of waveforms such as Sine, Sawtooth, Triangle and Square wave. This allows users to create a variety of sounds.

2)MIDI Handling: processes MIDI messages to control the oscillator as part of synthesizer design.

3)EQ with adjustable center frequency, Q factor, and gain ( Parametric EQ with non â€“ constant Q )

4)Delay with Delay Time, Feedback and Wetness control with linear interpolated indices.

5)Output Gain Control: For ensuring plugin's output matches the desired loudness level.

6)Bypass toggle button: to bypass delay and Eq effect
